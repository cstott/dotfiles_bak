* From [[denote:20231128T084240][Tuesday 28 November 2023]]
- I work with people that seem to believe they are way better than they are.
- I downplay what I'm capable of doing in certain situations but in others brag (maybe too much)?
- Need to apply self-awareness so I am chasing the right opportunities (vs. options presented to me).
- Not happy with
  - the money (and options) I have
  - the roles I have
  - the responsibilities I have
  - the learning/skills I have
- these items are all on me
  - what behaviours are creating the situation that I'm in
  - what benefits am I getting out of my behaviours
  - what decisions (or non-decisions) am I making to create the situations that I'm in
  - why do I tolderate being passed over or letting less competent people pass me?
