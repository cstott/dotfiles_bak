Interactions are weird. I have to be careful not to "one-up" people when exchanging stories. It's not my intent but it probably happens more than I realize. I get so caught up in the discussion I forget to let others take the spotlight. It's not that I need it, I just have lots of "different" stories to share. Relaxed a bit and later interactions went better.
