1.   
  Some people find a way no matter how “impossible” it seems.  
  
  They are innovative problem solvers.  
  
  They have the conviction that there's always a solution.  
  
  These are the people we want.  
  
  They’re like water.  
  
  They find a path around any obstacle.  
  
5. Optimism  
  
Entrepreneurship is a roller coaster.  
  
Having optimistic people on your side is a massive mental boost.  
  
Optimistic people don't see roadblocks, they see stepping stones to success.  
  
Their energy is electrifying and infectious.  
  
A must-have when the going gets tough.

The ROI on constant learners compounds.  
  
In a fast-moving world, learning and adapting is essential.  
  
These hires:  
  
• Seek feedback  
• Expand their skills  
• Stay curious and hungry  
  
Train them well, and they'll give you an infinite return on your investment.  
  
5. Not Being an Asshole  
  
It might sound simple, but it's vital.  
  
I don’t care how smart, hardworking, or optimistic you are.  
  
If you don’t:  
  
• Show empathy  
• Collaborate well  
• Treat others with respect  
  
I don’t want you on my team.  
  
Period.

Work can be intense.  
  
Having people who bring:

• A sense of humor  
• A lightness to the office  
  
Makes a world of difference.  
  
When we make work feel like play, we're unstoppable.  
  
7. Growth Mindset  
  
This one is foundational.  
  
I need someone who:  
  
• Embraces challenges as growth opportunities  
• Believes abilities and intelligence can be developed  
  
People with a growth mindset get obsessed with the process.  
  
Not fixated on the outcome.  
  
8. Enjoys Responsibility  
  
I need my team to take on responsibility.  
  
I don’t want to chase people down.  
  
If they:

We'll perform better.  
  
And I’ll have way more breathing room and feel more at ease.
