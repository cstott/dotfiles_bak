### Notes
- [[Scrum Master vs Agile Coach]]
- Time entry for employs
	- Are supposed to use codes provided. Talked to Raihan and he's working on refining the process so hold off for now.
	- ![[Employee Cost Tracking Codes.png]]
	- Business needs to figure out how to sustain in future (we can provide estimates based on cloud costs, labour depends on management)
	- Minh hasn't been given any direction other than shutting down specific (existing) AFEs
	- Do we need to look at existing cloud costs for products
		- Trading project
		- Retail project
		- No - Raihan is going to handle this
	- How do we want to let the business know they should be paying for?
		- We will cover cloud costs for items in yellow (in list)
		- Richard/Raihan/Mona made continue/stop decisions
